\textbf{R24}: The system shall gracefully degrade if the weather service is unavailable.

\textbf{R25}: The system shall gracefully degrade if the geocoding service is unavailable.

\textbf{R26}: The system shall prevent GPS data loss on network unavailability or disconnection.

\textbf{D1}: Smartphone GPS accuracy of \textpm 10 meters in open environment with slightly degraded accuracy in urban canyons and indoor spaces. Accuracy metadata is user viewable.

\textbf{D2}: Sustained velocity of \(\geq 5\) km/h successfully distinguishes biking from walking or running. Helps in avoiding artificial triggers.

\textbf{D3}: External weather services like OpenWeather or similar provide data with great availability along with \(< 5\) second response time. Temporary outages are handled gracefully.

\textbf{D5}: GPS coordinates are recorded at a frequency \(\geq 1\) per second providing sufficient information for the system to reconstruct meaning bike paths.

\textbf{D6}: The published Biking Paths remain in the said condition for weeks/months. Construction or maintenance on the biking routes can be intermittent and the status of the path doesn't change daily. 

\textbf{D9}: The system uses GPS for historical trip recording and for path discovery. the system doesn't provide real-time tracking or emergency location sharing.

\textbf{D10}: All users have reliable connection to open a session on the app, to search existing routes, start a new trip or do manual searching of routes by entering origin - destination. Connection leeway if offered for trip stopping, weather enrichment and so.\\
