    \item \textbf{R5}: The system shall restrict an \verb|UnregisteredUser| to path querying and visualization functionalities only. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Trip Recording and Sensing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R6}: The system shall request \verb|User| permission to access GPS and motion sensors on the device.
    \item \textbf{R7}: The system shall detect biking activity based on a established minimum sustained velocity.
    \item \textbf{R8}: The system shall allow a \verb|RegisteredUser| to initiate trip recording.
    \item \textbf{R9}: The system shall display real-time trip data during recording.
    \item \textbf{R10}: The system shall allow a \verb|RegisteredUser| to pause and resume trip recording.
    \item \textbf{R11}: The system shall allow a \verb|RegisteredUser| to discard a trip before final upload.
    \item \textbf{R12}: The system shall compute trip statistics.
    \item \textbf{R13}: The system shall store a completed trip and its data if the \verb|RegisteredUser| confirms saving it.
    \item \textbf{R14}: The system shall allow a \verb|RegisteredUser| to view past trips and access trip history. 
    \item \textbf{R15}: The system shall prevent GPS data loss during network unavailability. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Weather Enrichment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R16}: The system shall retrieve meteorological data for a completed trip from an external service.
    \item \textbf{R17}: The system shall attach weather information with the trip if available.
    \item \textbf{R18}: The system shall allow the \verb|User| to manually refresh weather enrichment.
    \item \textbf{R19}: The system shall gracefully degrade if the weather service is unavailable. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Manual and Automated Path Contribution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R20}: The system shall allow a \verb|RegisteredUser| to manually insert bike path information.
    \item \textbf{R21}: The system shall allow a \verb|RegisteredUser| to review and confirm automatically acquired path information.
    \item \textbf{R22}: The system shall publish path information when the \verb|RegisteredUser| makes it publishable.
    \item \textbf{R23}: The system shall allow a \verb|RegisteredUser| to control the publication of contributed path information. 
    \item \textbf{R24}: The system shall gracefully degrade if the geocoding service is unavailable.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Path Discovery and Visualization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R25}: The system shall compute a \verb|PathScore| for each path based on \verb|PathStatus| and obstacles present on path.
    \item \textbf{R26}: The system shall list routes ordered by descending \verb|PathScore|.
    \item \textbf{R27}: The system shall allow any \verb|User| to visualize routes on an interactive map.
    \item \textbf{R28}: The system shall allow any \verb|User| to query paths between an origin and a destination. 
\end{itemize}
