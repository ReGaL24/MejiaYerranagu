\section{Requirements Traceability}

This section describes the relationship between the functional requirements of the Best Bike Paths (BBP) system specified in the RASD and the architectural components defined in the Architecture Design section of this document. The traceability mapping identifies the components responsible for realizing each requirement, ensuring that all required functionalities are covered by the proposed design and that responsibilities are clearly distributed among system components.
